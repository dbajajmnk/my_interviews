# 2. Real-Life Analogy

Day 05 keeps the GOJ structure familiar while translating it into Rust-native ownership, type safety, async, systems and production reasoning.

# 3. Visualization

```text
Change → SOLID/Pattern → Trait/Enum/Generic → Trade-Off
```

# 4. Mind Map

```text
SOLID, DRY, KIS, YAGNI & GoF Creational/Structural
├── Ownership / Lifetimes
├── Types / Traits / Enums
├── Runtime / Layout
├── Concurrency / Async
├── Errors / Safety
├── Debugging / Clippy / Miri
├── Backend / Data / Production
└── Interview Defense
```

# 5. Two-Hour Execution Plan

```text
00–15  Rapid recall
15–55  P0 topics
55–85  Hands-on/debugging
85–105 Google drill
105–115 Follow-ups
115–120 Readiness gate
```

# 6. Engineering Integration

> **Concept → Rust Guarantee → Ownership/Lifetime → Runtime/Executor Boundary → Failure → Evidence → Trade-Off**

# 7. Hands-On Integration

Complete a focused Rust hands-on exercise integrating the core concepts from Day 05.

# 8. Google Interview Drill

Defend the Day 05 design under changed ownership, concurrency, performance, security or scale assumptions.

# 9. Day-Level Common Mistakes

Unnecessary clones, unwrap in recoverable paths, Arc<Mutex> everywhere, blocking async work, unsafe without invariants, over-generic APIs, premature optimization.

# 10. Day-Level Best Practices

Ownership first, explicit Result/Option, small traits, enums for closed states, cancellation-aware async, minimal unsafe, Clippy/tests/Miri, Evidence First / No Bluff.

# 11. Interview Questions

Explain three key topics, one compiler guarantee, one runtime cost, one failure/debug artifact and one alternative.

# 12. Google-Level Follow-Ups

What changes under multithreading, async cancellation, dyn Trait vs generics, unsafe/FFI, 10× traffic or a different persistence model?

# 13. Quick Revision

```text
Who owns it?
Who borrows it?
What lifetime relation exists?
Does it allocate/clone?
Static or dynamic dispatch?
Can it block/panic/deadlock?
What proves the issue?
```

# 14. Day Readiness Gate

- [ ] Every P0 topic READY.
- [ ] Hands-on complete.
- [ ] Drill complete.
- [ ] Ownership/lifetime/runtime behavior explainable.
- [ ] Two follow-up changes survivable.
- [ ] No invented evidence.

**DAY READY:** 80%+ and no P0 failure.
