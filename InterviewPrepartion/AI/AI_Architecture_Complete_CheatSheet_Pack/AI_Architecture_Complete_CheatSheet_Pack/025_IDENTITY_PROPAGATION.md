# Identity Propagation

## Problem / Intent

Carry authenticated identity through retrieval, tools and audit without embedding raw secrets in prompts.

## Architecture View

```text
User identity → policy context → downstream
```

## Design Guidance

- Keep ownership and trust boundaries explicit.
- Define the source of truth for state and data.
- Treat model output as untrusted until validated.
- Make retry, timeout, failure, and fallback behavior explicit.
- Version models, prompts, retrieval indexes, tools, and policies independently.
- Attach trace, cost, security, and evaluation signals to the boundary.

## When to Use

Use this pattern when the architectural driver described above is present and measurable.

## Avoid / Trade-Off

Do not introduce the layer only because it is fashionable. Each distributed AI layer adds latency, operational cost, compatibility work, and another failure mode.

Identity?
Authorization?
Sensitive data?
Prompt injection?
Tool permissions?
Audit?
Tenant isolation?

## Production Review
