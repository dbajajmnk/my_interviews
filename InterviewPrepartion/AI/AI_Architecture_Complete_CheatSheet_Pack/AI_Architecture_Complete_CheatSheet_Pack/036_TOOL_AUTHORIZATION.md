# Tool Authorization

## Problem / Intent

Validate tool name, arguments, resource scope and user permission outside the model.

## Architecture View

```text
Tool proposal → deterministic auth → execute
```

## Design Guidance

- Keep ownership and trust boundaries explicit.
- Define the source of truth for state and data.
- Treat model output as untrusted until validated.
- Make retry, timeout, failure, and fallback behavior explicit.
- Version models, prompts, retrieval indexes, tools, and policies independently.
- Attach trace, cost, security, and evaluation signals to the boundary.

## When to Use

Use this pattern when the architectural driver described above is present and measurable.

## Avoid / Trade-Off

Do not introduce the layer only because it is fashionable. Each distributed AI layer adds latency, operational cost, compatibility work, and another failure mode.

Identity?
Authorization?
Sensitive data?
Prompt injection?
Tool permissions?
Audit?
Tenant isolation?

## Interview Recall

> **Tool Authorization:** Validate tool name, arguments, resource scope and user permission outside the model.
